Advanced Enforcer V37

	Well, you asked for it so you got it...
	See the release notes for some rather cool new toys
	and features ;-)

	Included in this archive is the public release archive.  This
	is the archive format that will be used in the public release.
	Please check it over.  If all goes well, it will be the
	archive released to the public.  Please do not release this
	archive until I clear it for release.

	Thank you very much for all of your help testing!

the same as the old Enforcer.
