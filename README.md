# Amiga Enforcer

This is a snapshot of my Amiga Enforcer source from my Amiga.

I have not touched this code in some time but people are still using it actively in the Amiga world so I figured I should put it out there as a github project to document the source and allow forks as long as they maintain the Copyright.

See the Enforcer directory that hold a copy of my source directory.

See [my Enforcer page](http://www.sinz.org/Michael.Sinz/Enforcer/index.html) for the original web page and binary downloads.

Unfortunately, much of the RCS history in Enforcer is lost due to bugs in RCS and CVS that we had back in the day.  A number of the files were "truckated" in ways that broke the history or worse.  I will see if I can get more history that works but it does not look good.
