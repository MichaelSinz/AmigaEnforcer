# Amiga Enforcer

This is a snapshot of my Amiga Enforcer source from my Amiga.

I have not touched this code in some time but people are still using it actively in the Amiga world so I figured I should put it out there as a github project to document the source and allow forks as long as they maintain the Copyright and are public.  As such, I have chosen to distribute this under the Apache License.

## Where is the code?

See the Enforcer directory that hold a copy of my source directory, including the SMakefile that builds the archives and such.  This is designed to run natively on the Amiga and depends on the SAS/C compiler we used to build much of the Amiga platform.

The only changes to the files are those needed to license the code under the Apache License.

See [my Enforcer page](http://www.sinz.org/Michael.Sinz/Enforcer/index.html) for the original web page and binary downloads.

## Change history?

Unfortunately, much of the RCS history in Enforcer is lost due to bugs in RCS and CVS that we had back in the day.  A number of the files were "truckated" in ways that broke the history or worse.  I will see if I can get more history that works but it does not look good.

## Why?

> In recogrnition of the continued interest in the Amiga and the amazing group of people keeping this wonderful retro computing platform alive, having the code around and potentially enhanced by those is something I can do for the community.  Having worked on and developed parts of the Amiga, that time of my life was very special and produced live long friends and family.

> I had put up, a long time ago, some pages on my web site, about Enforcer but over the decades, I have not had time (or hardware) to do much more with this, even though I still have great love for the Amiga.
>
> I hope that his provides a way for the legacy of the Amiga and Enforcer's role on the Amiga, to continue to live.
