# Amiga Enforcer

This is a snapshot of my Amiga Enforcer source from my Amiga.

I have not touched this code in some time but people are still using it actively in the Amiga world so I figured I should put it out there as a github project to document the source and allow forks as long as they maintain the Copyright.

See the Enforcer directory that hold a copy of my source directory.

See [my Enforcer page](http://www.sinz.org/Michael.Sinz/Enforcer/index.html) for the original web page and binary downloads.
